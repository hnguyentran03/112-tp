# 112-tp
My tp is going to be called 112maze and it is going to be a maze game that uses raycasting to create 3D visuals. The objective would be to collect a key and get to the end of the maze which is in a fixed location. As you progress through, the difficulty increases by a longer maze (with diffeerent maze generation algorithms) or different enemy (with different pathfinding algorithms) placements or different key placements. Key and enemy placements are random.

To run the project, run the visuals.py file. No libraries or additional files need to be downloaded other than the ones in this repository.

The controls are w,a,s,d to move up, left, down, right respectively. To turn your camera left and right, use the left and right arrow keys. To find the path to the next maze objective (a key or a goal), click p. To toggle the minimap, click m. To restart, click r.

To skip to level 5 (for perfect maze generation), click 5.
